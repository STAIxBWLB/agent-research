# agent-research (`ares`)

Research engine for the agent family ([agent-hub](https://github.com/STAIxBWLB/agent-hub), [agent-mem](https://github.com/STAIxBWLB/agent-mem), [vault-mem](https://github.com/STAIxBWLB/vault-mem), [agent-console](https://github.com/STAIxBWLB/agent-console)). The plan and phases are in [#1](https://github.com/STAIxBWLB/agent-research/issues/1).

This release implements phase A1: a literature study with an append-only ledger, approval gates, search across public paper indexes, screening, extraction cards, identifier verification, a BibTeX file and a citation check for drafts. Experiments, manuscripts, memory and the console panel are later phases and are not in this package.

## Install

Requires Bun 1.4.2 or newer. Not yet published to npm; run from a checkout:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun bin/ares.js --help
```

Register the MCP server with an agent host by hand, for example `claude mcp add ares -- bun /path/to/agent-research/bin/ares.js mcp`.

## Workflow

```sh
ares init study --question "How do research agents verify citations?"
ares scope study --file scope.json          # question, subquestions, include, exclude, yearFrom, yearTo, maxCandidates
ares gate approve study scope
ares lit search study "citation verification agents"
ares lit list study
ares lit screen study <id>... --include --reason "on topic"
ares lit card study <id> --file card.json   # summary, claims, methods, findings, limitations, relevance
ares lit verify study
ares gate approve study screen
ares lit bib study                          # writes study/refs/references.bib
ares cite check study draft.md              # exit 1 on unknown or unverified [@keys]
```

`ares playbook` prints the full standalone workflow and its rules. Every command takes `--json`.

## What the checks mean

- **verified**: the DOI exists at Crossref or DataCite, or the arXiv id exists at arXiv, and the registry's title and year match the candidate. It never means a paper supports a claim.
- **unknown**: the registry could not be reached or answered incompletely (network failure, rate limit, server error, error or truncated feed). Run `ares lit verify` again; unknown is never treated as missing.
- When a record shows that two candidates are the same work, an unscreened one is folded in; otherwise both are flagged `duplicates`, and `ares lit bib` refuses while both are included.
- Only included and verified papers enter `references.bib`. Citekeys never change once assigned.

## Gates

`scope` binds to the content of `scope.json`; `screen` binds to the set of included papers. Changing either returns its gate to pending. With `--autonomy auto` a pending gate is approved as `auto` when a command needs it; with `gates` (default) someone must run `ares gate approve`. The ledger records who approved: a person, an agent (detected from the agent environment) or `auto`. Which of them may approve is the workspace's policy, not the tool's.

## Study files

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `study.json` | question, mode, autonomy |
| `ledger.jsonl` | append-only events with actor and time |
| `scope.json` | the scope |
| `literature/candidates.json` | merged candidates, screening and verification |
| `literature/cards/*.json` | extraction cards |
| `refs/references.bib` | generated bibliography |

## Environment

| Variable | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENALEX_API_KEY` | OpenAlex key (without it, requests share a small daily budget per IP) |
| `S2_API_KEY` | Semantic Scholar key (without it, searches are often rate limited) |
| `ARES_CONTACT_EMAIL` | contact address added to the User-Agent |

Keys are sent with requests only; they are never written to the study.

## Not implemented yet

Experiment phases, sealed evaluation, manuscript build, vault-mem reference notes (after vault-mem#73), agent-mem conventions, agent-hub campaigns, the console plugin, `ares setup`, scheduled searches, the `copilot` and `step` autonomy modes.

## Development

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check   # typecheck, boundary check, tests (no network), package dry-run
```
